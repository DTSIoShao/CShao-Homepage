# About Me
I am Chengyang Shao (邵城阳), currently a PhD student of MIT mathematics department, supervised by [Gigliola Staffilani](https://math.mit.edu/~gigliola/).

I am interested in evolutionary partial differential equations, especially those arising from geometric or physical backgrounds.

Here is my [CV](https://github.com/DTSIoShao/CShao-Homepage/files/7204117/CV_of_Chengyang_Shao.pdf).
