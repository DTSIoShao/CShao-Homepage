# Notes Composed for Various Purposes

## Lectures at YMSC, Tsinghua University, 2021 Spring
During 2021 spring, I was on a position of visiting scholar at Yau Mathematics Science Center (YMSC) of Tsinghua University, sponsored by Prof. Pin Yu (于品). I gave a total of nine lectures on nonlinear analytic techniques with applications to the study of nonlinear dispersive differential equations, and the first eight of them were based on lecture notes composed by myself. These lecture notes are still subjected to modification.
### Lecture 1: Littlewood-Paley Theory
Brief description of Littlewood-Paley decomposition of functions; how regularity properties are related to convergence properties of the Littlewood-Paley building blocks; primary exposition of para-product of J. Bony.
### Lecture 2: Para-differential Calculus
The forbidden (1,1) symbol class and corresponding pseudo-differential operators; para-differential operators; symbolic calculus of para-differential operators.
### Lecture 3: Some Applications
Brief description of J. Bony's microlocal regularity theorem; classical quasilinear hyperbolic differential equation, via para-differential calculus.
### Lecture 4: The Water Waves System
The Dirichlet-Neumann operator in Euclidean spaces; local well-posedness of the gravity-capillary water waves system via para-differential calculus.
Lecture 5:
